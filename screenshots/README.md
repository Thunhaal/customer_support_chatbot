## 🚀 Deployment Details

### ✅ Dialogflow Console Testing
All intents were tested using Dialogflow’s built-in test console to verify correct intent matching and responses.

### ✅ Telegram Bot Deployment
The chatbot was deployed live on Telegram, allowing users to interact with it in real time.

Example queries tested:
- Hi  
- Where is my order  
- I want a refund  
- Random text  

### ✅ Web Demo Integration
Web Demo integration was enabled to allow website embedding.  
Due to Dialogflow ES legacy iframe restrictions, the public embed link may not render consistently across browsers, but the integration is correctly enabled.
